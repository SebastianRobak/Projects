    CONSOLE APPLICATION : Drone Simulation Project Overview
========================================================================

This project is about controling drone in simulation. It allows user to 
control drone (rotate and move). If user makes drone move in such way that
it hits obstacle, drone doesn't move. User can add multiple obstacles wherever
he wants. 

Cmake should be compiled to create output file to execute.
